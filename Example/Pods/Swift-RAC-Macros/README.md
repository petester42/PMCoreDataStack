Swift-RAC-Macros
================

(Temporary) Replacements for the RAC and RACObserve macros in Swift.

The ReactiveCocoa team is [hard at work](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/tree/swift-development) on an update to the library that will incorporate a native Swift API. Until that's complete, you can use this to use these Objective-C-style functions *with the understanding* that you should eventually look into the Swift API, once it exists.
